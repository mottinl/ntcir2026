# SciClaimEval Shared Task: Dataset Information

## Subtask 1: Claim Label Prediction Task
Each sample includes the following information:

- ```paper_id```: the ID of the paper; it can be an arXiv ID or a PeerJ ID
- ```claim_id```: the ID of the claim
- ```claim```: the claim for which the label needs to be predicted
- ```label```: there are two labels in our dataset: Supported and Refuted
- ```caption```: the caption of the evidence file
- ```evi_type```: the type of the evidence file, it can be **table** or **figure**
- ```evi_path```: the path to the evidence file; for the table evidence, we use the path to the PNG version
- ```evi_path_original```: this is only available for samples that use a table as evidence: the original path to the table, which can be a .tex or .html file
- ```context```: the preceding sentences from the same paragraph, provided as a short contextual field for each claim sentence
- ```domain```: three domains, ML, NLP, and PeerJ (medical domain)
- ```use_context```: **No** (the claim is understandable without context), **Yes** (short context is needed; information is taken from the context field), or **Other sources** (the full paper is needed to understand the claim)
- ```operation```: how the evidence is modified to obtain the modified evidence that pairs with the same claim to create a refuted sample
- ```paper_path```: the path to the paper
- ```detail_others```: if the operation is **Others**, a description is provided here
- ```claim_id_pair```: one claim is paired with two pieces of evidence, creating two labels: Supported and Refuted
- ```license_url```: the license information for this sample
- ```license_name```: the license information for this sample

Please refer to the file [task1_ground_truth](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task1_ground_truth.json) for an example.


Please prepare your prediction file following the format in [task1_pred_format](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task1_pred_format.json).



## Subtask 2: Claim Evidence Prediction Task
In addition to the fields used in the first subtask, the second subtask includes the following new field:

- ```sample_id```: the ID of the sample
- ```question```: all samples in the second subtask use the same question:
```Which piece of evidence supports the claim? Only return the evidence ID (for example, evidence_id_1 or evidence_id_2).```
This question asks the model to predict the evidence file that supports the claim. Please follow the provided format when answering
- ```evidence_id_1```: the path to the first evidence file
- ```evidence_id_2```: the path to the second evidence file

- Please refer to the file [task2_ground_truth](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task2_ground_truth.json) for an example.


- Please prepare your prediction file following the format in [task2_pred_format](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task2_pred_format.json).



## Information about the Test Set:

- You will receive the input for the test set, but the gold labels are not available.
Please refer to the file [task1_test_input.json](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task1_test_input.json) for an example; the following keys are missing: label, operation, detail_others, and claim_id_pair.

- [task2_test_input.json](https://github.com/SciClaimEval/sciclaimeval-shared-task/blob/main/examples/task2_test_input.json) is the test input example for the second task.



## Evaluation
### Run both tasks (default)
```bash
python3 run_eval.py
```

### Run only Task 1
```bash
python3 run_eval.py --task task1
```

### Run only Task 2
```bash
python3 run_eval.py --task task2
```

### Use custom file paths
```bash
python3 run_eval.py --task task1 --ground_truth_task1 path/to/gt.json --pred_task1 path/to/pred.json
```
